# Overview

This project is a basic ESRGAN model and its basic goal is to give us a sample of how a normal picture would like after low lightly enhanced by specific models such as ESRGAN ,SwinIR or BSRGAN . This low light enhancement is vital in many fields and lets look some of its application

# Applications


 ## Space exploration:
 * Astronomical exploration: Enhances the visibility of distant celestial objects, enabling better observation and study of stars, galaxies, and other astronomical phenomena.
 * Satellite Imaging: Improves the quality of images taken by satellites, especially in low-light conditions like nighttime or shadowed areas on planets.



 ## Microbiology:
 * Fluorescence microscopy: Enhances the visibility of fluorescently labeled specimens, allowing for better visualization of cellular structures and functions.
 * Pathogen Detection: Improves the detection of low-concentration pathogens in samples, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases.


 ## Industrial applications:
 * Surveillance system: Enhances the performance of security cameras in low-light conditions, improving the ability to monitor and secure industrial facilities.
 * Quality Control: Improves the inspection of products on production lines, especially in low-light environments, ensuring higher quality standards.
